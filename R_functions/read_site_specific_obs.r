# CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework (CARDAMOM) and DALEC terrestrial ecosystem model suite
# CARDAMOM is a Bayesian model-data fusion software framework. CARDAMOM is used to 
# assimilate observations and ecological theory to retrieve parameters for the 
# DALEC suite of intermediate complexity terrestrial ecosystem models. DALEC can be
# used as a fully integrated component of CARDAMOM or independently.
