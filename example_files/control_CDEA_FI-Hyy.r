## Stage
# stage -1 : Create project first time (load source to eddie)
# stage  0 : Re-compile source code, if needed but without re-creating the PROJECT related infofile.RData
# stage  1 : Create met / obs containing files for the specifc project
# stage  2 : Submit the project to eddie
# stage  3 : Copy back results and process vectors
# stage  4 : Do some standard figure creation (and further processing for gridded analysis)
stage=-1
repair=0 # to force (=1) re-run processed results or driver files if they already exist
grid_override=FALSE # force site specific files to be saved and figures to be generated when in "grid" operation
