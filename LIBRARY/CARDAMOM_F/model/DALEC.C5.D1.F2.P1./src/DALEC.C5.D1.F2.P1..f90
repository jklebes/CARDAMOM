    ! The Data Assimilation Linked Ecosystem Carbon - Combined Deciduous
    ! Evergreen Analytical (DALEC_CDEA) model. The subroutine calls the
    ! Aggregated Canopy Model to simulate GPP and partitions between various
    ! ecosystem carbon pools. These pools are subject to turnovers /
    ! decompostion resulting in ecosystem phenology and fluxes of CO2

    ! This version includes the option to simulate fire combustion based
    ! on burned fraction and fixed combusion rates. It also includes the
    ! possibility to remove a fraction of biomass to simulate deforestation.

        ! fine and coarse roots may subsequently undergo mortality from which they do not recover
